Installing and maintaining Docker:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#:~:text=Install%20from%20a%20package&text=Go%20to%20https%3A%2F%2Fdownload,version%20you%20want%20to%20install

There are several steps above to install the Docker Engine (not desktop), confirmed on Ubuntu Jelly

however this maybe all that is required:

sudo apt-update

sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y



To set the current user to be a member of the Docker group

# Get a docker image from docker hub eg:

# https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu



# pull a specific version (tag) of ubuntu

docker pull ubuntu:18.04



# pull latest version available of ubuntu

docker pull ubuntu



# list imaged you have pulled, which will be located here:

# /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256

docker image ls



# now create and run docker containers (ie a running machines) from an image

docker run -d -t --name myubuntucontainer ubuntu

docker run -d -t --name myubuntu18container ubuntu:18.04



# docker containers will be here

# /var/lib/docker/containers



# list docker containers that are running

docker ps



# stop a running docker container

docker stop myubuntucontainer



# list all docker containers both running and stopped

docker ps -a



# Connect to a docker container by executing a bash shell on the container

docker exec -it myubuntu18container bash

ps -a



# Exit docker connection

exit



# rename an existing container

docker container rename  myubuntu18container2 ubuntu-18.04-c1



# now connect to it again

docker exec -it ubuntu-18.04-c1 bash
